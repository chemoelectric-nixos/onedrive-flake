= A Nix Flake for the OneDrive Client at abraunegg.github.io

The code here is based on the Nixpkgs implementation of the ‘onedrive’
package.

You can download a tarball from one of the tagged versions, and then
run the configure script. It is controlled by the settings of some of
what are called ‘precious variables’ (in Autoconf
terminology). Alternatively, you can use a pre-configured flake
directly from the GitHub repository. For example,

[source,nix]
----
onedrive = {
  url = "github:chemoelectric-nixos/onedrive-flake/v1.1.2?dir=build%2Fx86_64-linux%2Frelease-25.05%2Fonedrive-2.5.7%2Fsystemd-true";
};
----

is a setting for an AMD64 GNU/Linux system with NixOS 25.05, using
systemd to control onedrive.
